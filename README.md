## Who We Are

We are an interdisciplinary research group working at the interface of **machine learning, synthetic biology, and enzyme engineering**.  

Our mission:  

> Build models that translate **sequence → function**, and use them to discover and design enzymes that matter.

We combine **computational modeling** with **wet-lab experimentation**, enabling a full loop from hypothesis → prediction → experiment → better models.

Lab culture is really important - we aim to be:
- Inclusive
- Collaborative 
- Scientifically ambitious 
- Supportive and fun

## Research Focus

We develop **machine learning methods for enzyme discovery and design**, grounded in real experimental validation.

Our core idea:  

If we can learn to map **protein sequence directly to biochemical function**, we can scale discovery to the **billions of enzymes sampled from nature**.

Why this matters:

- Enables discovery of distant functions across evolutionary scales  
- Makes enzyme design scalable  
- Supports antibiotic development and resistance mitigation  
- Allows model-guided experimental exploration  

Because we run both computational and experimental labs, we can:

- Generate missing training data  
- Run lab-in-the-loop active learning  
- Test high-impact questions directly  

Example question we care about:

> Can we design antibiotics that are both potent and less susceptible to resistance?

## The Team

We currently have **5 local** and **2 global** members.


**Ariane Mora**

- Principal Investigator, AITHYRA, Austria (from 2025)  
- Postdoc in enzyme engineering (wet + dry lab), California Institute of Technology (Caltech), USA – Frances Arnold Lab (2023–2025)  
- PhD in Computational Biology, The University of Queensland, Australia (2019–2023)  
- Background in Computer Engineering --> transitioned into computational biology  

### Postdocs
- **Gabriela** – Evolutionary biology; generating new antibiotic enzymes with DNA language models  
- **Béla** – Synthetic biology & ML (joining 2026)

### Technician
- **Manuel** – Synthetic biology; building our automated enzyme evaluation pipeline  

### PhD Students (Local)
- **Luca** – Biotechnology; contrastive learning for protein fitness prediction  
- **Sebastian** – Chemistry; using DPO to identify improved catalysts  

### PhD Students (Remote)
- **Will** (Brisbane, Australia) – Flow matching for enzyme mechanisms  
- **Ikumi** (Tokyo, Japan) – Biosensor design

## Techniques & Tools

### Experimental
- Enzyme screening (lysate & whole-cell systems)  
- LC–MS  
- HPLC  
- Plate reader assays  
- Automated evaluation pipelines  

### Machine Learning & Statistics
We use the method that best fits the biological question:
- Contrastive learning  
- Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)  
- Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Collaborations

We actively collaborate across Europe and Australia:

- New-to-nature chemistry with the Reisenbauer Lab (ISTA, Austria)  
- Peptide-based chemistry with the Nguyen Lab (EPFL, Switzerland)  
- Causal inference for enzyme mechanisms with Dr. Loomba (Imperial College London, UK)  
- Bioinformatics and evolutionary methods with the Boden Lab (University of Queensland, Australia)  

And we’re always open to new collaborations 🙂
